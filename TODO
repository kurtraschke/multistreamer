* Remove extraneous menu items (mostly done now).
* Wire up copy/paste and/or drag-and-drop for moving streams between stream lists.
* Implement undo/redo for operations:
	Add stream
	Remove stream
	Set playing
	Set mute
	Set balance
	Set volume
* Add icon for application and documents.
* Eventually, implement help.
* Provide for scriptability, if it can be done.
* Figure out some way to signal to the user if a stream drops out?
* Closing a window doesn't actually seem to stop the streams in that window.  Fix.
