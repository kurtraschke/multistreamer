* Remove stream button should be disabled when nothing is selected
* Implement preferences panel and preference option for autoplay
* Remove extraneous menu items (mostly done now)
* Bundle type, creator code, UTI
* Implement undo/redo for operations:
	Add stream
	Remove stream
	Set playing
	Set mute
	Set balance
	Set volume
* QTHelper should be a subclass of QTMovie, ideally.
* Eventually, implement help.
* Provide for scriptability, if it can be done.
* Figure out some way to signal to the user if a stream drops out?
